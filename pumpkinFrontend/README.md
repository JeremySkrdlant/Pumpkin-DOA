# PumpkinFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.13.
I used 14 because later versions seem to have issues with ethers 6. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Serve to Students 
```
  ng server -o --host 0.0.0.0
```
